# TAC_FSRPD

1. Figure1_triangle.m
    - FSR analysis (95% confidence region and support) of unicycle dynamics with
      fixed turning rate sequence and velocity as a triangular distributed rv
      (about 5 with end points at 4 and 6).
2. Figure2.m 
    - Comparison between Algorithms 1 and 2. Use figure number (1, 2, or 3)
      within this script to get other plots
3. Figure3.m
    - Avoid set corresponding to obstacle as a Dubins vehicle --- construct a
      finite union of convex and compact sets
4. FigurePmf.m
    - Construct the probability mass function describing the turning rate
      preferences
